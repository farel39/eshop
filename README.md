# Reflection 1
Below is how i implement clean code and secure coding practices

## 1. Clean Code Principles
### 1.1 Meaningful Names
Applied:

- Class names like Product, ProductRepository, ProductService, and ProductController are meaningful and describe their purpose.

- Method names like create, findAll, findById, update, and deleteById are clear and indicate their functionality.

- Variable names like productData, productId, productName, and productQuantity are descriptive.

### 1.2 Functions
Applied:

- Methods in the ProductRepository, ProductService, and ProductController are small and focused on a single responsibility.

- The create, findAll, findById, update, and deleteById methods are concise and perform one task each.

### 1.3 Comments
Applied:

- The code is mostly self-explanatory, so there are no unnecessary comments.

### 1.4 Objects and Data Structures
Applied:

- The Product class is a simple data structure with getters and setters, adhering to the principles of encapsulation.

- The ProductRepository uses a List to store products, which is appropriate for this use case.


### 1.5 Error Handling
Applied:

- The findById method in ProductRepository returns null if the product is not found, which is a simple way to handle missing data.

## 2. Secure Coding Practices
### 2.1 Authentication
Applied:

- Not implemented in the current code. 

### 2.2 Authorization
Applied:

- Not implemented in the current code. 

### 2.3 Input Data Validation
Applied:

- Basic validation is performed in the HTML forms using th:field and input types like text and number.


### 2.4 Output Data Encoding
Applied:

- Thymeleaf automatically encodes output data to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.

I did not find any mistakes in the source code but there could be improvements on it. This include implementing authentication, authorization, input data validation, etc. 

# Reflection 2
## 1. Unit Test
### How do i feel after writing the unit test?
- I feel more secure and safe about my code because unit test gives confidence that the code behaves as expected and helps catch issues early. It also forces me to think about edge cases and how my code might break.

### How many unit tests should be made in a class?
- Thereâ€™s no fixed number of unit tests for a class. It depends on the complexity of the class, number of methods, edge cases, and behavioral requirements. But as a rule of thumb, aim to test all public methods and all significant logic paths in your class

### How to make sure that our unit tests are enough to verify our program? 
- Test all scenarios
- Use Code Coverage Tools
- Check for Edge Cases
- Refactor Tests
- Peer Review

### If you have 100% code coverage, does that mean your code has no bugs or errors? 
- No, 100% code coverage does not guarantee bug-free code. Coverage Only Measures Execution. I might have 100% coverage but still miss edge cases or invalid inputs.
## 2. Functional Test

### What do you think about the cleanliness of the code of the new functional test suite? Will the new code reduce the code quality? Identify the potential clean code issues, explain the reasons, and suggest possible improvements to make the code cleaner!

Issues:
- Code Duplication. It violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, making the code harder to maintain. If the setup logic changes, you would need to update it in multiple places.
- It can make the test class harder to read and understand.
- It violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Causes Tight coupling that reduces flexibility and makes it harder to modify or extend the test suite in the future.

Improvements:
- Extract Common Setup Logic into a Base Class

```java
package id.ac.ui.cs.advprog.eshop.functional;

import io.github.bonigarcia.seljup.SeleniumJupiter;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.boot.test.web.server.LocalServerPort;

@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@ExtendWith(SeleniumJupiter.class)
public abstract class BaseFunctionalTest {

    @LocalServerPort
    protected int serverPort;

    @Value("${app.baseUrl:http://localhost}")
    protected String testBaseUrl;

    protected String baseUrl;

    @BeforeEach
    void setupTest() {
        baseUrl = String.format("%s:%d", testBaseUrl, serverPort);
    }
}
```
Now, the CreateProductFunctionalTest and the new test suite can extend this base class like below
``` java
class CreateProductFunctionalTest extends BaseFunctionalTest {
    // Test methods
}

class ProductListFunctionalTest extends BaseFunctionalTest {
    // Test methods
}
```
- Use Helper Methods for Repeated Actions
```java
protected void createProduct(ChromeDriver driver, String productName, String quantity) {
    driver.get(baseUrl + "/product/create");
    driver.findElement(By.id("nameInput")).sendKeys(productName);
    driver.findElement(By.id("quantityInput")).sendKeys(quantity);
    driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("button[type='submit']")).click();
}
```
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Use Descriptive Test Method Names
- Avoid Hardcoding Values
